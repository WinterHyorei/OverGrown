<b><font size=3 color="gray">A Mysterious pandemic caused the death of about 1/4 of humanity. United, the rest of the global super powers and conglomerates created a new governing body with emphasis to controlling whats left of humanity by constructing Megawalls to contain and better the chance of humanities survival.</b><br><br>
<b>Due to the dwindling resources the new governing body named the Global.Wall.Coalition established 'The 13 Megawalls Project' built around 13 different locations globally big enough to encompass entire countries with unique and necessary variety of resourcess. Due to its success in keeping the pandemic out and ensuring absolute safety for its inhabitants, 50 smaller walls were built by private sectors built encompass cities that is scattered all over the world outside the Megawalls in which they now reside in.<br><br>
To combat the decline of natural resources like <font color="green"><i>Plant life</font>, <font color="red">Accessible food</font>, <font color="white">Knowledge</font>, <font color="orange">Confidence</font>, and <font color="blue">Physical Adaptability</font></i> The Coalition funded companies to bio engineer <i>Artificial Solutions.</i>With the goal of making sustainable living inside the walls. </font></b>
